# Shared Package

Shared types, contracts, and constants consumed by backend services and the frontend. Builds to CommonJS for easy consumption from NestJS runtimes.

## Scripts

- `pnpm build`: compiles sources into `dist/`.
- `pnpm test`: executes package-level tests (Vitest).
- `pnpm lint`: checks TypeScript files with ESLint.
- `pnpm format`: formats sources with Prettier.
